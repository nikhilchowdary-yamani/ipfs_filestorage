and decentralized dataset that saves the asset's history. Security and storage are the
most challenging aspect. The classical technique's issues and challenges are an encouragement
for developing a fresh block chain-assisted IPFS model with access control
policies. </p>
<p align="justify"><font size="3" style="font-family: Comic Sans MS" color="black">
Hence, this research paper introduces an effective access control and authentication
based on an interplanetary file system (IPFS)-based block chain and access
control system for attaining secured transactions. The developed method comprises
five entities, that is smart contract, data owner, data requester, block chain and IPFS
along with eight phases, to be exact setup, user registration, initialization, storage and
data encryption, authentication, testing, access control, and decryption phase, to provide
better access control and storage capacity. The proposed IPFS-based block chain
and access control system offered effective storage and secure transactions in the
block chain network.
